Section1: Numbers

Variables and Ints
myfirstnumber = 23

Floats
floatfun = 1.23

Create a float by dividing two numbers and name it divisionfun
divisionfun = 3/2

Divide 365.25 by 7 and round it to 1 decimal point. Assign the result to a variable named weeks
weeks = round(365.25 / 7, 1)

I have created two variables for you, pi and age. Use conversion to turn pi into an int and turn age into a float.
pi = int(3.14)
age = float(8)

Section2: String

emojifun = "ðŸ˜˜"

'''
hello hi how are you
i am learning python
from udemy
'''

quote = "My friend doesn't like the word \"cheese\""

name = "Julie"

age = "42"

sentence = "Hi my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name,age)

tdfw = "turn down for what"
print(tdfw.upper().replace("WHAT","CHEESE"))


lyric = """Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time, I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the West End
Knock out, but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers"""
print(lyric[-38:])


Section4: If Statements

fun = True
if fun:
    print("We're having fun!")
else:
    print("This is no fun")


year = 1830 # When you check your solution, don't change this number

if year > 2000 and year < 2100:
    print("Welcome to the 21st century!")
else:
    print("You are before or after the 21st century")

age = 14
height = 65

if age >= 18 or height >= 60:
    print("Hop on the coaster!")
else:
    print("You can't ride!")
